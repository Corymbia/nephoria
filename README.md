eutester is an attempt to leverage existing test code to make test writing faster and standardized.  

Installation
------
If easy_install is not available in your environment use your package manager to install python-setuptools
    
    yum install python-setuptools gcc python-devel git
    apt-get install python-setuptools gcc python-dev git

Installing eutester and its dependencies is as easy as:

    easy_install eutester

For development purposes you can then clone the code from github and then reinstall with your changes

    git clone https://github.com/eucalyptus/eutester.git
    cd eutester
    [CHANGE CODE]
    python setup.py install


### Branches
Eutester vs. Eucalyptus compatibility matrix:

A new version of Eutester is released with every new version of Eucalyptus and the
compatibility matrix goes as the following pattern: 

| Branch    | Eutester Version | Eucalyptus Version |
|-----------|------------------|--------------------|
| master    | 1.0.0            | 4.2.0              |
| maint-4.1 | 0.0.x            | 4.1.x              |


Main Classes
------
eutester contains the framework pieces like parsing config/creds, setting up connections and providing test primitives.
`Eucaops` uses the framework provided by eutester to provide validated higher order operations on those cloud connections.
For more information regarding the module structure of eutester, please refer to the [Eutester Python Module Documentation Index](http://packages.python.org/eutester/py-modindex.html).

Example test cases written with this library can be found in the testcases/unstable directory of the source tree

Design
------

Eutester is designed to allow a user to quickly generate automated tests for testing a Eucalyptus or Amazon cloud.
In the case of testing a private cloud a configuration file can be used to create cases that require root access to
the machines. The config file describes a few things about the clouds configuration including the bare metal machine
configuration and IPs.

The `Eucaops` class can be imported in order to use pre-defined routines which validate common operations on the cloud:

    from eutester.euca.euca_ops import Eucaops

Constructor
------

The basic constructor can be used for 2 different connections:

1. Private cloud with root access - CLC SSH, Cloud, and Walrus connections
    Purpose - connect to and manipulate Eucalyptus components using boto and command line. Recommended to use Eucaops.  
    Required arguments: root password, config file with topology information
    Optional arguments: credential path so that new credentials are not created

        tester = Eucaops(password="my_password",  config_file="config_file")
        
        # Get all instances
        tester.ec2.get_instances()
        
        # Get all accounts
        tester.iam.get_all_accounts()
        
        
        
2. Public cloud - local SSH, EC2 and S3 connections
    Purpose - can be used to wrap euca2ools commands installed locally on the tester machine or with Eucaops
    Required arguments: credential path

        tester = Eucaops(credpath="~/.eucarc")
        tester.ec2.run_image(image) ## run an m1.small instance using image

Possible values are EDGE, VPCMIDO, MANAGED, MANAGED-NOVLAN

Columns
------
    IP or hostname of machine  
    Distro installed on machine  
    Distro version on machine  
    Distro base architecture
    System built from packages (REPO) or source (BZR), packages assumes path to eucalyptus is /, bzr assumes path to eucalyptus is /opt/eucalyptus
